# OWL Stats Comparison Tool
Professor Payal:
You can connect and run the program by connecting to the EC2 instance created in homework 3. Navigate to the Project folder and use the command python3.7 main.py to run the program. Everything else was already configured

To run the code install Python3.7 and required packages. Create the database and create the tables defined in the table definitions file. Then run each of the Loader files to populate the database. Then run main.py to use the program.

The program was developed and tested in Windows 10 but also lightly tested in Ubuntu. The code should not be OS dependent.
I used Postgres 11 and asyncpg 0.20, the code is developed in Python 3.7.
